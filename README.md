    - es6 for lib, data, test
    - browser, not node for `data/`

- `addons-linter` with `.addonslinterrc`

- ci with Travis OR CircleCi (TODO)

- ability to do code coverage, using `grunt-istanbul` and [`istanbul-jpm`](https://github.com/freaktechnik/istanbul-jpm)

- uses Grunt to do some of the heavy lifting.  Sorry if you hate Grunt.  [I do as well](#1).

- TODO:  Allow better build of React type things for front ends

## Assumptions and Opinions

1.  All code lives in `lib` and is ES6.
2.  All website stuff (web-workers, ui) lives in `data`
3.  Index at `lib/index.js`
4.  Grunt, b/c it makes instrument / coverage easier

    - `grunt-istanbul` + `istanbul-jpm`
    - if you want or need `make`, `gulp`, `webpack` you absolutely can

5.  All the testing happens in a create `testing-env` folder, so that

    - it can use a custom `.jpmignore` file
    - it can do coverage with less silliness

6.  As built, the tests will fail, until you fix the facade tests.
8.  You are somewhere with some resemblence to Unix cli (Linux or OSX).

## Suggestions

1.  You may like to use [`chai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for testing.
