## Important notice

### We are moving to WebExtensions

This is a work in progress branch for [supporting a pure WebExtension workflow in this template](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template/issues/53).

The latest template depends on version 5 of [shield-studies-addon-utils](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils/) (also work in progress), so until it has been published via npm, you will need to check it out manually and use npm link:

```
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils -b develop
cd shield-studies-addon-utils
npm link
cd ../shield-studies-addon-template # or wherever you have checked out this template repository
npm link shield-studies-addon-utils
```

Note: After the above, the template's modules/shield-studies-addon-utils folder will be a symlink to your locally checked out shield-studies-addon-utils repository.

## About This Repository

This repository is intended as an example repository containing templates and good
practices for creating a [Shield Study](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Shield/Shield_Studies) add-on for Firefox.

This repository is based on WebExtensions, which are the way forward for extensions in Firefox.

### Aims

The aim is to bring together tools and services we've used on other Shield Study add-ons
(e.g. [dataleak-pioneer-shield-study](https://github.com/motin/dataleak-pioneer-shield-study)) into a template/example repository, so that new projects can come
along and get a infrastructure together quickly, and be up and running with code,
test suites, coverage etc quickly.

### Documentation

It is intended that all parts of this repository have at least outline
documentation. If you find any parts that are missing, please file an issue or
create a PR.

### Using this template

2. Make this README reflect your study (including removing all of this `About This Repository` section, keeping `Seeing the add-on in action` and below)
3. Build your study add-on and make the docs reflect your study
4. File issues/PRs against https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template/ when you come across things to improve in the template
