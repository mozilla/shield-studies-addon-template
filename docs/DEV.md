### Preparations

* Download Developer and Nightly versions of Firefox (only Developer/Nightly will allow bundled web extension experiments, and Developer is the default target for the automated tests)

## Getting started

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

## run
npm start

## run and reload on filechanges
npm run watch

# run and reload on filechanges, with a variation/branch set by preference
~~npm run watch -- --pref extensions.button-icon-preference_shield_mozilla_org.test.variationName=kittens~~

# run and reload on filechanges, with a specific Firefox installation
npm run watch -- -f "/Applications/Firefox Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin"

## lint
npm run lint

## build
npm run build
```

## Details

First, make sure you are on NPM 6+ installed:

```shell
npm install -g npm
```

Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template.git
```

After cloning the repo, you can run the following commands from the top level directory, one after another:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

This packages the add-on into an zip file which is stored in `dist/`. This file is what you load into Firefox.

## Loading the Web Extension in Firefox

You can have Firefox automatically launched and the add-on installed by running:

```shell
npm start
```

Note: This runs in a recently created profile, where no changes will be saved. For more information, see <https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext>

To automatically reload the extension on file changes:

```shell
npm run watch
```

To load the extension manually instead, open (preferably) the [Developer Edition of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) and load the `.zip` using the following steps:

* Navigate to _about:debugging_ in your URL bar
* Select "Load Temporary Add-on"
* Find and select the latest zip file you just built.

## Seeing the add-on in action

To debug installation and loading of the add-on, check the Browser Console that is automatically opened on start. (Usually accessible using Firefox's top menu at `Tools > Web Developer > Browser Console`).

This will display Shield (loading/telemetry) and log output from the add-on as long as the preference `shieldStudy.logLevel` is set to `All` or similar.

See [TESTPLAN.md](./TESTPLAN.md) for more details on how to see this add-on in action and hot it is expected to behave.

## Format code using prettier and eslint --fix

```shell
npm run format
```

## Generate stub code and API docs

```shell
npm run generate
```

Generates stub code and API docs from `src/privileged/*/schema.yaml`. See <https://github.com/motin/webext-experiment-utils> for more information.

## Automated testing

```shell
npm test
```

Runs both unit and functional tests.

### Unit tests

```shell
npm run test:unit
```

Runs unit tests using Karma.

Code at [./test/unit/](./test/unit/). Configuration at [./karma.conf.js](./karma.conf.js).

Code coverage is instrumented by the istanbul babel plugin and is only enabled and reported for those files that use the babel preprocessor in [./karma.conf.js](./karma.conf.js).

Note: [The karma firefox launcher](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-firefox-launcher) expects that the firefox binaries are located in slightly different places than `web-ext`. Example on how to workaround this on OSX:

```shell
cd /Applications/
ln -s FirefoxBeta.app FirefoxAurora.app
ln -s Firefox\ Nightly.app FirefoxNightly.app
```

### Functional tests

(To run the functional tests, package.json has to be updated to reflect the built add-on zip filename the declaration of `npm run test:func` - this is silly and there is an issue about it here: https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template/issues/75 - but we are stuck with having to manually update it for the time being.)

```shell
npm run test:func
```

Runs functional tests using the Selenium driver, verifying the telemetry payload at Firefox startup and add-on installation in a clean profile, then does **optimistic testing** of the _commonest path_ though the study for a user:

* prove the notification bar ui opens
* _clicking on the left-most button presented_.
* verifying that sent Telemetry is correct.

Code at [/test/functional/](/test/functional/).

Note: The study variation/branch during tests is overridden by a preference in the FIREFOX_PREFERENCES section of `test/utils.js`.

The functional testing set-up is a minimal set of tests imported from <https://github.com/mozilla/share-button-study> which contains plenty of examples of functional tests relevant to Shield study add-ons.

## Directory Structure and Files

```

```

This structure is set forth in [shield-studies-addon-template](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template), with study-specific changes found mostly in `src/background.js`, `src/privileged/` and `src/studySetup.js`.

## General Shield Study Engineering

Shield study add-ons are web extensions (`src/`) with at least one background script (`src/background.js`) and one or more embedded Web Extension Experiments (`src/privileged/*/api.js`) that allows them to run privileged code.

Privileged code allows access to Telemetry data, user preferences etc that are required for collecting relevant data for [Shield Studies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Shield/Shield_Studies).

It is recommended to build necessary logic and user interface using in the context of the web extension whenever possible and only utilize privileged code when strictly necessary.
