# Telemetry sent by this add-on

## Usual Firefox Telemetry is unaffected.

* No change: `main` and other pings are UNAFFECTED by this add-on.
* Respects telemetry preferences. If user has disabled telemetry, no telemetry will be sent.

## Study-specific endings

This study has no surveys and as such has NO SPECIFIC ENDINGS.

The STUDY SPECIFIC ENDINGS this study supports are:

* "voted",
* "notification-x"
* "window-or-fx-closed"

## `shield-study` pings (common to all shield-studies)

[shield-studies-addon-utils](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils) sends the usual packets.

## `shield-study-addon` pings, specific to THIS study.

Events instrumented in this study:

* UI

  * prompted (notification bar is shown)

* Interactions
  * voted

All interactions with the UI create sequences of Telemetry Pings.

All UI `shield-study` `study_state` sequences look like this:

* `enter => install => (one of: "voted" | "notification-x" | "window-or-fx-closed") => exit`.

## Example sequence for a 'voted => not sure' interaction

These are the `payload` fields from all pings in the `shield-study` and `shield-study-addon` buckets.
